description:  We both have really grown to love gardening - Billy, especially. Ever since we first bought our house, we eagerly built our garden with raised beds, berry bushes, and grape vines. Each year, the anticipation of seeing our crops thrive fills us with joy. Every year, we eagerly watch our crops like blueberries, zucchinis, cucumbers, tomatoes, strawberries, grapes, and blackberries flourish. We end up with so much that we love sharing the bounty with friends and family. It's just so rewarding!

                    Dear Birth Family, <p>

                    Hello and thank you for considering us as potential parents for your child. We are excitedly preparing to welcome a child into our lives through adoption.<p>

                    We met quickly after we both graduated from college and have built a life centered around family, love, and creating a warm, supportive home. Sarah is a dedicated Software Engineer with a passion for cooking and reading, while Billy is a Software Engineering Manager who enjoys woodworking and spending time outdoors. Together, we cherish our large, close-knit families and love hosting gatherings where everyone feels welcome.<p>

                    Our home is filled with laughter, creativity, and the joy of our two dogs. We have created a nurturing environment with a big backyard for playtime and a cozy playroom for reading and movie nights. We look forward to sharing our love for exploration, learning, and the simple pleasures of life with a child.<p>

                    As we embark on this journey, our hearts are open with anticipation and gratitude for the opportunity to provide a loving, stable, and nurturing home for your child. We understand the importance of this decision and promise to cherish, support, and celebrate every moment of your child's life.<p>

                    Thank you for considering us. We look forward to the possibility of getting to know you and sharing more about ourselves.<p>

                    With warmth and hope,<p>

                    Sarah & Billy
